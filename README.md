# Kaboom Store
Shopping cart app for an electronics store, built as my 3rd React project.

## Features
- Consumes the FakeStoreAPI to fetch data about products and display them on the page
- Usage of hooks: useState to manage application states such as the products in the cart and the API data, and useContext to share these states across the app reducing code repetition.
- Dynamic single-page application
